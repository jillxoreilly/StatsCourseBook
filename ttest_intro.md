# The t-test

This week we are introducing the concept of hypothesis testing, and looking at one of the most commonly used statistical tests, the t-test.

After this week you should be able to carry out, using <tt>scipy.stats:</tt>

<ul>
 <li>   Independent samples t-test
<li>    Paired sample t-test
 <li>   Single sample t-test 
</ul>

There are videos explaining the logic of each of these tests on the website.

You should also understand the following theoretical concepts:

<ul>
<li>    Paired samples and repeated measures designs vs independent samples designs
<li>   Assumption underlying a statistical test, and specifically the assumptions of normality and independence underlying the t-test
</ul>
