# In 1885 Francis Galton famously collected data on the heights (amongst other features) of a large number of family groups - over 800 individuals
# 
# These data were important in the development of some classic statistics (like correlation) and some important ideas (like regression to the mean).
# 
# Plotting these data we can see how histograms could work for a larger dataset
