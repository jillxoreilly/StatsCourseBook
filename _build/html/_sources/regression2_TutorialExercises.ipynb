The outcome measure of interest is ‘better’ and is a score from 0-10 in answer to the following question: “Is the UK made a worse or a better place to live by people coming to live here from other countries?” 0 is labelled as “Worse place to live” and 10 as “better place to live”, or respondents could choose an answer in between. Thus, high scores indicate more open attitudes, i.e., those who feel more positive about the consequences of immigration, and low scores the opposite. \n",
