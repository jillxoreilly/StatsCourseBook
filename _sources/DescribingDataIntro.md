# Describing Data

This week we are thinking about how to describe data. We will cover two topics:

<b> Plotting data </b>
... including choosing an appropriate plot and the correct plot settings (bin sizes)

<b> Descriptive statistics</b>
... including measures of centre (mean, median, mode), measures of spread (variance, standard deviation, inter quartile range, percentiles), and description of distributions (shape and skew).

## Outcomes

After this week you should be able t di the following:

### Descriptive statistics
<ul>
<li>	Calculate mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, inter quartile range, percentiles 
<li>	Make predictions about the shape of a distribution from summary statistics (for example, what is the skew for a distribution where the median is higher than the mean?) 
<li>	Appreciate common factors affecting the shape of distributions (what happens when a measure can only take values above zero for example). 
</ul>

### Plotting
<ul>
<li>	Plot data using a histogram choosing appropriate bin sizes and
locations
<li> Plot data using a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot
<li> Plot data using a rug plot 
<li>	Plot paired data using a scatter plot
<li>	Plot data using a box and whisker plot
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	Describe the shape and skew of a distribution in words (based on viewing a data plot)
<li>	Identify and comment on outlier data points and describe strategies for coping with these.
</ul>
