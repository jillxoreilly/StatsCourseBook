# Plotting Data

This week we are thinking about how to plot data.

We will learn to produce plots with Python, using the packages <tt>matplotlib</tt>
and <tt>seaborn</tt>

We will also think about how to make good choices when plotting data -
choosing an appropriate type of plot and appropriate scaling,
labeblling and settings



After this week you should be able to do the following:

<ul>
<li>	Plot data using a histogram choosing appropriate bin sizes and
locations
<li> Plot data using a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot
<li> Plot data using a rug plot 
<li>	Plot paired data using a scatter plot
<li>	Plot data using a box and whisker plot
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	Describe the shape and skew of a distribution in words (based on viewing a data plot)
<li>	Identify and comment on outlier data points and describe strategies for coping with these.
</ul>
